"""qRP-Sweep: Capacitated Region Partitioning with a Sweep method
This method is based on [1] and [2], and has the following simple structure.

Algorithm
---------
There is a "planning" phase in which we divide the delivery region into
`num_clusters` sub-regions. Then, in the "execution" phase, we route each
incoming package to its closest sub-region, and add it to a vehicle. This is
repeated until each vehicle is full, when a TSP is solved.

Besides being an old reference, it became the basis for many recent methods. In
fact, the difference among them is in how we define the sub-regions. According
to [1], the only constraint is that each one has the same probability of having
a new incoming package.

To achieve that, we follow here the sweep method of [2]. Basically, think about
a circle centered at the centroid of the historical deliveries. We can convert
the demands into polar coordinates, each one with angles in the interval
[-pi, pi]. The sweep method consists in spliting this interval into
`n_clusters` sub-intervals, each one having almost the same number of packages.

Assumptions
-----------
The number `n_clusters` to divide the region may be provided. If not, we choose
as default the maximum number of vehicles we required among each training
instance. This number is estimated as the ratio of total demand and an
individual vehicle's capacity.
